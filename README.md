# Introduction

Where is a dandelion's home? 

The theme, "what home means to you," inspired us to create a game about how a dandelion seed finds "home" in the wind. Player will control the wind to carry the seed. It's a game about the journey of dandelion seed, from an "original home" to a "new home". The player will drag mouse while holding the left button to draw the trace of the wind and release the button to complete drawing. To achieve the goal effectively, try finding an appropriate rhythm to maneuver the mouse.
